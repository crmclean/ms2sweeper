The goal of this file is to generate a text file for the T pseudonana 
paper that can be run through mummichog.

```{r}
t_pseudo <- read.csv(here::here("data/t_pseudonana_xcms.csv"))
mummichogOut <- data.frame("m/z" = t_pseudo$mass_to_charge, 
           "rt" = t_pseudo$retention_time, 
           "p-value" = 0.05, "t-score" = 1)
write.table(x = mummichogOut, file = here::here("data/t_pseudonana_mummichog_in.txt"))
```
