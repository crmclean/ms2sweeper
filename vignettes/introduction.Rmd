# Introduction

ms2sweeper is an R package designed to find and retreive ms/ms spectra within 
whenever available for a given feature for the analysis of metabolomics data. 
If multiple scans for a single are available, the program does its best to 
return the cleanest possible spectra. Through the cleaning processes, noise 
peaks are removed. 

# Installation

To install this package, please type the following command into the R console:

```{r}
devtools::install_github("crmclean/ms2sweeper")
```

The installation will hopefully be acccessible through other servers in the 
future.
